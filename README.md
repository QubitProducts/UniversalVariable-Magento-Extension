# Magento Extension for Universal Variable

Qubit's Universal Variable streamlines the process of passing values between OpenTag and your pages, whilst future-proofing against updates and changes. We recommend creating the relevant JavaScript object on your page prior to deploying OpenTag's container script. Doing this will assure that all values will be present on the page when the script runs and can be used by libraried OpenTag scripts. You only need to declare the object variables you use. For example, if your pages only have category and no subcategory, just declare the category. Likewise, if you feel the need to extend objects, or feel like renaming them, please do so. However, please take a note of the new variable names, as these are needed to access your scripts in your OpenTag container.

## Example Usage (Coming Soon)
